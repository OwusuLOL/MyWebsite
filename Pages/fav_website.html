            <p> If I had to choose a website as my overall favorite, I would have to choose a website that is a platform since I enjoy seeing other creatiosn and possibly building upon that. That is why I chose github, github is a very popular website as it is the 52nd most popular website worldwide with 192 million visits this month. This website acts as a platform that allows you to share or see others projects that can be written in any coding language out there, such as HTML, Python, or JS. Anyways, this is my favorite website out there currently.</p>
